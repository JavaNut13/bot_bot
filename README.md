# Bot Bot

_Slackbot for maximising university group project productivity_

Created to aid group 1 (aka Swagoverflow) in SENG302 2016. The first version of this bot was written in Ruby using [realtime-slackbot](https://github.com/JavaNut13/realtime-slackbot) but moved to Elixir to handle the daily reminders, etc.

All URLs and keys in config files should be invalidated by now. I will add a sample config file later (maybe).
